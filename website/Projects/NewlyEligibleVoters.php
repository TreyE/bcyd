<div id="TitleRow">Registration of Newly Eligible Voters</div>

<div id="Content">
It was recently ruled that Maryland residents who will turn 18 before the November 4th general election may register to vote in the February 12th primary.  The deadline for new voter registration is January 22nd.  Therefore, a group of otherwise unaffiliated volunteers are working together to get 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds informed of their right to vote, and to get them registered.    
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b> This is a project being done in a nonpartisan way by a bipartisan group of volunteers.  This registration effort is not done in support of any party or candidate.<br>

<br><br>Please volunteer for this effort by <!-- filling out the information below or --> by e-mailing BCYD President Don Engel at <a href="mailto:donengel@techhouse.org">donengel@techhouse.org</a>.<!--<br><br>
