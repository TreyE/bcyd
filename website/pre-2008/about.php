	<span class="top">Preamble Statement:</span>
	<br />
	As Marylanders, we take great pride that the Democratic Party is the Party of the People. We value a fair and 
	responsive government and the merits of an active citizenry. As Baltimore County Young Democrats, we recognize 
	the need to actively participate in the political process and encourage all people to become informed and involved 
	in public decision making. We promote social awareness, community involvement, and political activism as a means to achieve 
	a more fair and just society.	
	<br />
	
	<span class="top">Mission:</span>
	<br />
	To encourage young people to become active members of the Democratic Party, to support the ideals of the 
	Democratic Party at all levels of government, to elect Democratic candidates, to stimulate in young people the 
	values for which the Democratic Party stands, and to provide young people with the skills and experiences they 
	will need to lead our nation into the future.
	<br />
	
	<span class="top">Vision:</span>
		<br />
We share a Democratic vision of a future where the rich care for the poor, where minorities are given the same rights as the majority, and where the government sits with the people and not above it.
